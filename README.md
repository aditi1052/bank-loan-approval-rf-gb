Bank Loan Prediction Using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model to determine whether a loan application is likely to be approved or not. This can help financial institutions speed up their approval processes and make data-driven decisions.

Dataset
Source: Bank loan dataset containing information on applicants like gender, marital status, income, credit history, etc.

Target: Loan_Status (Y/N) â€” whether the loan was approved or not.

ðŸ”§ Steps Performed
1.Data Cleaning:
  * Handled missing values in features like Gender, Married, Self_Employed, etc.
  * Dropped unnecessary columns (Loan_ID).

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (To be expanded visually):
  * Used .describe() and .value_counts() to understand the data.
  * Explored correlations and potential predictive variables.

3.Feature Engineering:
  * Converted categorical variables into numerical using label encoding/dummies.
  * Ensured balanced class distribution and no data leakage.

4.Modeling:
  * Applied Random Forest Classifier
  * Applied Gradient Boosting Classifier
  * Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.

5.Model Comparison:
  * Compared performance of both models to determine which works better on this dataset.
